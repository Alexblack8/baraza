# [ Baraza ]

Baraza is a social justice innovation that aims to facilitate conflict resolution at the domestic level and among community members. Baraza, presented as an android application, will allow community members seek an audience with their area chief or local administration from within the application for disputes or issues they want resolved. Additionally, they should be able to seek professional legal council from within the application.


## How it works
Traditionally, dispute resolution has worked in the following ways:
1. Aggreived party approaches relevant (local) authority figure, reports dispute.
2. Authority figure either summons both the aggreived party and the aggrevator, sits both down to a face-to-face meeting.
3. In face-to-face meeting, a resolution is passed by the authority figure.

The Baraza mobile application will digitize this process. The application allows a user to report a dispute arising, allows the local authority figure(chief) to see reported disputes relevant to their areas, and allows the chief to perform some action as per the dipute either pass a resolution from within the application or summon the parties. The passed resolution, either in person or throught the application is recorded by the dispute and records kept.
